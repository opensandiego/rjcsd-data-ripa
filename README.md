Making Sense of California Racial Identity Profile Act (RIPA) Data.  

This repository is the first data project that will be offered by the [Racial Justice Coalition of San Diego]([http://](http://www.rjcsd.org/) so that they, a coalition of like-minded organizations, can understand local policing practices.   

This project focuses on making RIPA data for the City of San Diego usable to RJCSD Coalition members to query, analyze, and output  visualizations and reports to help inform others about their findings. 

Data is found here (CTL+ click for new tab):
1. [Actions taken](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-ripa-actions-taken/)

The California Code of Regulations (CCR) details what RIPA should contain in [CCR Title 11. Law, Division 1. Enforcement, Chapter 19.](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/ripa/stop-data-reg-final-text-110717.pdf?)

A [RIPA Board](https://oag.ca.gov/ab953/board) oversees related activities throughout the state. "The Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory (RIPA) Board was created “for the purpose of eliminating racial and identity profiling, and improving diversity and racial and identity sensitivity in law enforcement.”
